# Leetcode Ratings

Surface [Zerotrac](https://zerotrac.github.io/leetcode_problem_rating/#/) ratings directly on LeetCode problem pages so you can pick the best problems to practice.

## Why this exists
- LeetCode's built-in difficulty labels are useful but sometimes misleading. Zerotrac provides community-driven ratings that offer a complementary signal about problem difficulty and quality.
- This extension saves time and improves practice quality by showing Zerotrac ratings next to problem titles.

## What it solves
- Quickly identify problems worth solving for learning or interview practice.
- Avoid wasting time on problems with noisy or misleading difficulty labels.

## Key features
- Adds an inline Zerotrac rating to LeetCode problems (runs only on `https://leetcode.com/problems/*`).
- Minimal, non-intrusive UI designed to blend with LeetCode.

## Demo

## How to use

- Load the extension unpacked in Chrome (Developer mode → Load unpacked) and select the `dist` folder.
- Visit any LeetCode problem and check for the Zerotrac rating near the problem title.
